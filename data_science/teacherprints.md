#### Motivation

TeacherPrints is a free instructional coaching app that utilizes personalized, data-driven visualizations to help teachers bring the reality of their lesson delivery in line with their expectations and goals. We apply Pytorch-based voice-type classification and speech activity detection deep learning models to audio recordings of instructional interaction in the classroom. Through a combination of Python for analysis and d3.js for visualization, we transform these data into an intuitive, customized summary of educationally important, talk-related features. Guided professional reflection and curated online resources help teachers translate TeacherPrints insights into actionable next steps for their class. Regular use of TeacherPrints allows teachers to document their progress and identify new instructional goals along their path to teaching excellence.
